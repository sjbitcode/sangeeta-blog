Summary: My current resources for learning forex.

This is officially the second post of this blog, and one of my goals here is to share my Forex journey with you all! I am currently learning forex trading from the following online platforms and books. This is a growing list and is subject to change in the future.

### Online Resources
- [BabyPips School of Pipsology](https://www.babypips.com)
- [EverythingFX](http://everythingfx.com)
- [Forex Boat](http://forexboat.com)

### Books
- [Forex For Beginners by Anna Coulling](https://www.amazon.com/Forex-Beginners-Anna-Coulling-ebook/dp/B00GBHQXZC)

### Reddit
- [Forex Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/)

BabyPips is a free and excellent platform with tons of articles, analyses, and a large forum. At the time of writing, I'm up to the Middle School section of the School of Pipsology. What I love about the BabyPips School is that off the bat, it is highly organized and detailed. There are quizzes at the end of each grade to make sure you're retaining what you've just read.

Another free forex resource is EverythingFX, brought to you by the [AstroForex](https://www.youtube.com/user/ReclaimReality) team. I haven't started digging into this yet, but I included it here since it looks similar to the BabyPips school approach for learning the foundations. There is also a wealth of articles and analysis offers great insights into the technicals of Forex trading.

Forex Boat is also another great platform for learning Forex, however all of their content is not free. I initially took their course on Udemy called [Forex Trading A-Zâ„¢ - With LIVE Examples of Forex Trading](https://www.udemy.com/forex-trading/), which I highly recommend as a starting point along with BabyPips. The material in this course is easily explained, and gives a good overview of the essentials without going into too much detail. I am now a member of Forex Boat which gives me access to all their courses, webinars, their Facebook community and monthly webinars. Nevertheless, anyone can visit their awesome articles about trading on their [blog](https://www.forexboat.com/blog/).

Currently, I am reading Anna Coulling's book, Forex For Beginners. Though I am not done with the book, I can only say good things about this book. You can also use this book as your starting point to the world of Forex. Each chapter is well written and there are great examples and explanations. Anna also introduces her preferred strategy (which I'll cover in future posts) which is not only helpful but refreshing to actually learn about someone else's strategy and their preferred technical tools.

Lastly, the Forex community on Reddit is a highly active and lively community, where all sorts of questions and information is shared. There is a page on this community for newcomers that offers a lot of links and other resources to get started. The reason I listed this here is because community plays such an important role in learning a new skill, and it is extremely important to be exposed to what other traders are saying.

As a final note, I am planning to release a series of posts dedicated to Anna's book and some of the key points of each chapter. Till then, take care!
